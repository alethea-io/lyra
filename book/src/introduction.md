# Introduction

Lyra is an indexing engine designed for the Cardano blockchain, primarily serving as a tool for developers who require efficient, read access to  blockchain data. 

Originating as a fork of Scrolls, Lyra's core functionality involves crawling the Cardano blockchain history to build and continuously update collections of on-chain entities, thereby reflecting the current state of the blockchain. By processing historical data and monitoring the chain's tip, Lyra ensures that these collections remain current, providing developers with a streamlined and accurate view of blockchain transactions and states.
